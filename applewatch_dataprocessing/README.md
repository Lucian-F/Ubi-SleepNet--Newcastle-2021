# sleep_classifiers

This code is adapted from [link](https://github.com/ojwalch/sleep_classifiers.git). 

## Getting Started

This code uses Python 3.7.

## Data

Data collected using the Apple Watch is available on PhysioNet: [link](https://alpha.physionet.org/content/sleep-accel/1.0.0/)

The MESA dataset is available for download at the [National Sleep Research Resource](https://sleepdata.org). You will have to request access from NSRR for the data.

Once the data has been download, please put all files along with the directories under the data folder.
## Features + figures

All raw data are cleaned and features are generated in ```preprocessing_runner.py.```

The file ```analysis_runner.py``` can be used to generate figures showing classifier performance.  You can comment and uncomment the figures you want to run.
